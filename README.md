# VR-Zombie-Survivor

You find yourself on an island in the middle of nowhere with only a flashlight for support, a 
handy pistol and a far away blinking light(possibly from a reception tower) there is no map all
you have are your senses to rely on so keep your eyes and ears open as there are some hungry
Zombies all around the island with AI pathfinding mesh thanks to some random evolution.
Good Luck see you on the other side.
